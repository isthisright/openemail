An open source application to make email better

With better processes emerging to manage engagment data email is makeing a come back in a big way. This project aims to take the technology powering some advances and speed up its adoption by open sourcing it.  I developed this framework over years of working with email software and after months of sleep deprevation I've been able to put together the architecture and intial code commit.  

I'm in need of a lot of help to turn this from a small minimum viable product to rolling it out on a scale thats more appropriate. If I can generate enough supprot I plan to release the results of everyones contribution under a public license in early 2017.  

I decided to go open source because the possibilities are endless in terms of where development and functionality could lead.  Some early use cases I'm working on include the ability to have an interactive shopping/customer service experience from the inbox.  Completing transactions and transfering and converting different stores of value using the massive email network.  And 10's to 100's of process improvements over the way companies put together and deploy emails today.

I know if we can get a product together this is an open source project that has massive potential in the every market from Non-profit to Fortune 500.  I'll say it because I know people are wondering at this point- No, it's not an email client. or an Email provider.  It's a web based application that sits between the 2 which allowing real time processing of engagement data to make email better for both the sender and receiver.

I've began with AngularJS but am still a novice. At a highlevel I need help configuring and implementing a more detailed data model and authentication process.  Three use cases that I'm working on having released first include:

  Allowing email senders to automate the tedious and time consuming elements of the production process by scraping content directly from their site. And keeping content more relevant by allowing emails to update dynamically in the inbox.
 
    
    Using DOM tags to correlate page loads to email opens and clicks to massively reduce the need for consumer data to be passed from server to server (to server to server) like it is today. 
    
    Allowing customers to query business inventory, trending articles, account balances, warranty info.... anything companies store in a database from their inbox.
    
    
I've been customer facing my whole career and havent had a ton of product exposure until the last 6-12 months but I can get in the technical weeds if you're serious about contributing.  

I decided to build this because my conversations with clients told me it was needed.  I decided to open source it because the potential for it is more than I can handle.

If you're interested in helping please reach out, comment or just send a commit.  

Thanks
